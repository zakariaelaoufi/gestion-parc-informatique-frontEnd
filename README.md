# **IT Asset Management Web Application**

In the context of my End of Studies Project, I developed an **IT Asset Management Platform** for the Autonomous Intercommunal Water and Electricity Distribution Authority of Fes (RADEEF), a well-known company. This platform aims to address a major challenge encountered by the organization: the effective management of its IT resources, particularly machine tracking.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Utilized **J2EE** technology with the **Spring Boot** framework, providing a robust and scalable architecture for the application.
- **Database**: Choose Mysql for reliable and widely used database management.
- **Frontend**: Employed a combination of **React**, **Material UI**, **React Query**, and **Redux** to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface, ensuring a modern and enjoyable user experience.

### Key Features

1. **Department Management**: Allows the creation and management of departments within the organization.
2. **Agent Management**: Facilitates the creation and management of agents.
3. **Machine Management**: Tracks the status of each machine (available, under maintenance, etc.) and generates barcodes for the machines.
4. **Adding Machines**: Enables administrators to add new machines with details such as name, type, and serial number.
5. **User Attribution**: Associates each PC, printer, etc., with a physical user by recording their information (name, ID, etc.).
6. **Machine Tracking**: Records and updates information on the status, location, and usage of machines.
7. **Reports**: Generates reports on the status of machines, assigned users, and more.
